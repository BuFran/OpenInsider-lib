Coding style
------------

The whole library is programmed using the Linux kernel coding style, see
http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for details.

Please use the same style for any code contributions, thanks!

Amendments to the Linux kernel coding style
-------------------------------------------

1) We use the stdint types. The linux kernel accepts the abbreviated types (u8,
   s8, u16 and so on) for legacy reasons. We should in general not introduce
   things like types ourselves as long as they are not necessary to make our
   job possible of refining the hardware and make it easier to be used. stdint
   is a standard and it is not in the scope of our project to introduce a new
   type standard.

2) Based on the same logic as in (1) we do not use __packed and __aligned
   definitions, it is not our job to add compiler extensions. If we need to
   deal with compiler incompatibility we will do that the same way we are
   dealing with the depricated attribute by introducing a normal macro that is
   not in the compiler reserved keyword space.

3) We accept to write an empty body busy waiting while loop like this:
	while (1);
   there is no need to put the colon on the next line as per linux kernel
   style.

4) We always add brackets around bodies of if, while and for statements, even
   if the body contains only one expression. It is dangerous to not have them
   as it easily happens that one adds a second expression and is hunting for
   hours why the code is not working just because of a missing bracket pair.
